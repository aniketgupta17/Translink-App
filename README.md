# Translink-App
For this assessment, you’ll be building a fully-functional TransLink data parser that provides a summary of buses for the “UQ Lakes station” bus stop. This is similar to what you might see on the screens at the bus stop, but it will run as a Node.js app in the terminal.

With this app, you’re asked to demonstrate all of what you’ve learned & practiced in Lectures & Contacts from Week 1 to 5. This includes, but is not limited to:

Techniques for functional programming in JavaScript:
A fully declarative programming style (minimising imperative);
Nested functions & communication between them;
Immutability and transformation of data within the app;
Recursion of data within the app;
Asynchronous programming through fetching of local & live data;
Consideration of dependancies management.
An easy to understand JavaScript code style:
Readable with a considered program structure, variable and function names;
Neatness with tabbing and whitespace;
Clear comments in plain English that provide a meaningful description of the code, such as in JSDoc style. Not verbose or excessive in quantity.
Use of modern JavaScript shorthand where appropriate to use;
Consideration of good practice via popular style guides.
